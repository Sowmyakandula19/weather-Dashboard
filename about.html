    <h1>About This Weather Dashboard</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Anime Weather Dashboard</strong> is a creative project that combines live weather data with beautiful animated backgrounds. 
      It transforms raw weather information into an engaging visual experience, making it easy and fun to check the forecast.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      This project fetches live data from the <strong>Open-Meteo API</strong> and processes current, hourly, and daily forecasts. 
      The weather codes are then matched with custom animations such as sunny skies, clouds, rain, snow, and thunderstorms. 
      The background changes dynamically to reflect real-time weather conditions, while users can search for any city globally.
    </p>
